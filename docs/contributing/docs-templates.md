title: Docs Templates

Docs reference guides, recipes, and tutorials teach Gatsby concepts to users with a variety of learning styles and skill-sets. _It's the Gatsby way of writing learning materials._

Here are some things to keep in mind when deciding where to contribute to Gatsby:

- [Blog posts](/contributing/docs-contributions#contributing-to-the-blog) are primarily made for case studies and time-sensitive storytelling.
- [Reference guides](#reference-guides), in contrast, are evergreen -- or continually relevant -- and discoverable documentation articles that go beyond any one case study or situation.
  - [Other guides](#other-types-of-guide-articles) add documentation for specific purposes like the API reference, Conceptual Guide, Gatsby Internals, and more.
- [Recipes](#recipes) add concise, discoverable, and easy-to-follow instructions for common Gatsby tasks. They are smaller units than tutorials.
- [Tutorials](#tutorials) should provide step-by-step guidance for Gatsby workflows, listing all pre-requisites and not assuming knowledge or skipping steps.

When writing (or reviewing) learning materials that show Gatsby users how to complete tasks, you are expected to **test out any code examples or steps to ensure they work**. This can also help with writing in your own words, rather than copying from other sources. If you have a demo project or code example that strengthens docs and you don't know where to put it, mention it to the Gatsby Learning team in a PR.

## Why use templates?

Here are templates (models) to follow when contributing to Gatsby docs to ensure that the docs accomplish their purpose. If you have a good reason to deviate from the following template structures, mention those reasons in the PR so others can give proper feedback.
